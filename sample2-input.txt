I got seriously nerd-sniped this week by a (real) problem mentioned by a distant colleague on Slack. You have a paragraph of text from which all punctuation (including spaces) has been removed. Given a full dictionary, in the form of a list of words, break the text up into its original words. However, since there are typically multiple possible solutions, the full task is to find all the possible parses of the input text.
