At some point I got some natural language text that after getting converted out of some sort of obscure unique plane or some such (visually still Roman characters) effectively had something done to it. Is there anything previously existing to go around doing dictionary word look ups on prefixes to go about adding the needed spaces to cut down on hand editing time and improve readability?
